# CSVGeocoder

This web app will take a csv file with a column name of 'Address' and create a new csv file with a latitude and longitude field added!

You can directly download it too after it makes the new form. 


No csv file to test? No worries! 
I have created a 'download test file' button that downloads a test file for you to test with!
