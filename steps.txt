frontend: 2 html files (index, success), main.css
  in frontend(index): title, what to do, choose file, upload/submit
  in frontend(success): extend index, wipe entry for chosen file, show new csv file with lat and lon as a table, download button, maybe show map?
    Catch errors: Need .csv file or equivalent, column with "address" or "Address", return None type if data used cannot return a lat and long

Backend: flask framework to host, pandas to read file, write new csv file with "lat" and "lon" columns added, maybe show map with folium?




Other ideas:
Add address directly to table? (check if address exists?)
